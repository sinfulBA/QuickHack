# QuickHack

If you're using Chrome, install: [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/h264ify/aleakchihdccplidncghkekgioiakgal?hl=en-US).
(allows YouTube to be played in lower quality)

Afterwards, right-click (or double-tap on trackpad) on your bookmarks bar, click on **Add Page**, then add whichever **Name** you would like, and put this entire script as the URL: `(javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/sinfulBA/QuickHack/master/hack.js');})();
This will manually enable the video-mode setting and will remove a lot of the visual CSS on the site, as well as put the *Skip* button out front.
