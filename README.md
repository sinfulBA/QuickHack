# QuickHack

1. If you're using Chrome, install: [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/h264ify/aleakchihdccplidncghkekgioiakgal?hl=en-US) *(allows YouTube to be played in lower quality)*

2. Also, make sure to go to YouTube, click on a video, and turn the video quality down to the lowest possible.

3. Afterwards, right-click (or double-tap on trackpad) on your bookmarks bar, click on **Add Page**, then add whichever **Name** you would like, and put this entire script as the **URL**: 

```javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/sinfulBA/QuickHack/master/hack.js');})();```

*This will manually enable the video-mode setting and will remove a lot of the visual CSS on the site, as well as put the *Skip* button out front.*


4. Next, when on plug.dj, first make sure **Video Only Mode (No Avatars)** is enabled.
You can enable it by clicking on the *Settings Gear* at the bottom right, then clicking on the setting under **Behavior**

5. Once it is enabled, click on the bookmark you previously made.
