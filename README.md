# QuickHack

If you're using Chrome, install: [this extension (allows YouTube to be played in lower quality)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/h264ify/aleakchihdccplidncghkekgioiakgal?hl=en-US).

Afterwards, drag this to your bookmarks bar: [script](javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/sinfulBA/QuickHack/master/hack.js');})();).
This will manually enable the video-mode setting and will remove a lot of the visual CSS on the site, as well as put the Skip button out front.
